This reliance manifests itself into a drive for profit at all costs within these corporations. Thus this treadmill of production, the capitalist economic model that creates ecological and social due to the inherent drive to make a profit, becomes apparent. Such a relationship can be observed in the interactions between local organizations and populations and these corporations within petropolises. These petropolises become the unity between satellite towns and the regional economy that are composed of oil refineries and petrochemical plants such as Port Arthur, Texas.",

Operated by Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), uranium drawn from it is exported all over the world to run nuclear power facilities. Though this uranium provides a relatively clean source of electricity for these countries, environmental injustices in the Ranger Mine site have arisen due to the extreme pursuit of profits by mining companies and their disregard for environmental and indigenous well being.",

The Four Mile mine is the most recent Australian uranium mine to begin operation and uses in situ leaching (ISL)  to recover mineral uranium. The Adnyamathanha people, the local indigenous tribe, were not fairly represented or considered when the Four Mile was being discussed and they experience a resource curse in which they are subject to a disproportionate quantity of hazards and are excluded from the benefits of uranium extraction.",

    "introText": "The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill of 2010, also commonly called the BP Oil Spill, is the largest accidental oil spill in history, with over 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico over a span of 87 days. The disaster took place on April 20th, about 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and resulted in 17 injuries, 11 deaths, and numerous environmental, economic, and social impacts on the region. This paper analyzes these impacts on the region, particularly those placed upon marginalized groups such as Southeast Asian and African American fishermen, and concludes that simple environmentally just practices such as communicating in proper languages were not performed to assist these groups in the aftermath of the spill.",

Since the 1980s, various political arguments have arisen regarding which sections of society have to pay the costs and enjoy the benefits of the dam construction. The construction of the dam was put off for several years due to this dilemma, and was finally approved in 1987.",
